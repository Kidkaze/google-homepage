Started the google homepage project on 21/04/2020 and honestly didnt even think I knew enough to complete this project.
Three long, painstaking days later I have uploaded my final copy of my interpretation of google.

It's not perfect, at all. the sign in button and web apps button of the navigation is irritatingly just out of sync with the rest of the nav. The search magnifying glass is a little too big and no matter what I do, I cant seem to seperate the footer properly. However, with all that being said, I have proved to myself that I can use CSS at least somewhat effectively to style a page and after a mini break, I will be coming back to fix up the issues listed above.

I have learned so much, from forcing myself to watch lots of videos and practice flexbox style, to learning about responsive CSS styling, and I absolutely adore the margin/padding combo. This project has helped me really understand the basic principles of CSS by having to apply (and read up on) a lot of the styling tools employed and I feel that when I come to do this exact project in a monthâ€™s time, it will not take me as long, nor frustrate me as much, as this go around.
